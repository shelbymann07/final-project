Rough Working Draft
=======================

Notes: 
- I would like to change the chart to reflect rape numbers when you click the button. I have what I think is the code for that specific chart, but I can't figure out how to implement it with the jQuery button. Also, it's from a different data set so I think I just have to set it up as an entirely new div, etc. 
- I don't like the lines or the formatting of the city labels, but I can't figure out how to change those... How does one target a specific line? Or adjust the padding between each label?
